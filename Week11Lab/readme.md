# Lab 11
In this lab, I learned how to validate data by examining how data validation works in MVC, how to control the user experience, how to customize server-side validation and how to customize client-side validation. I created an Events page that features 4 events. I also added data validation to the Contact page and the ProductModel, which will be tested in later lab.
